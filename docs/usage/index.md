# Usage

This page will give you an overview on how to use *kiara* via its command-line interface.

For a more walk-through introduction, have a look at the [Getting started](./getting_started.md) page.

## Subcommands

Sub-command specific information can be found on the following pages:

- [``run``](running_modules.md): run a workflow from the command-line
- [``module``](module_info.md): get information about modules and pipelines
- [``data``](data.md): get information about data in the *kiara* data store


## Getting help

To get information for the `kiara` command itself use the ``--help`` flag:

{{ cli("kiara", "--help") }}

The same goes for any of the sub (or sub-sub...) commands:

{{ cli("kiara", "module", "--help") }}

## Complex inputs
