# Running workflows

The *kiara* cli includes a command to execute a workflow via the terminal:

{{ cli("kiara", "run", "--help") }}

### Options

The most important parameters are the ``MODULE`` and ``INPUTS`` arguments, which will be explained below. Apart from those,
the command let's you costumize a few things:

``--id``
:    The id of the workflow, this affects the auto-generated alias(es) for output values if ``--save`` is used

``--module_config``
:    This option allows to provide configuration for a module. In most cases this won't be necessary, so we won't go into
     it here. The format of the configuration is explained [here](../../usage/#complex-inputs).

``--explain``
:    If this flag is set, *kiara* will print out information about the state of the workflow and its inputs/outputs.

``--output``
:    Let's you tweak the output of this command. In most cases, this won't be needed. Documentation for this will be added later.

``--save``
:    If set, the outputs of this workflow will be saved into the *kiara* data store. You can get see the stored items
     via ``kiara data list`` and the [other data-related subcommands](./data.md). The argument to this flag is a string,
     which can either contain a '=', which means the output field with the name that matches the first part of this argument
     will be saved as alias named after the second part. Or, if it doesn't contain a '=', all output fields will be saved
     as namespaced aliases, with the argument as first part, and the output field name as second.


### Arguments: *module* and *input*

Obviously, we need to specify the module we want to run (list available ones via ``kiara module list``). If we don't
specify any inputs (and the module in question doesn't have defaults for one or several inputs), *kiara* will tell us
what we need:

{{ cli("kiara", "run", "logic.xor") }}

Here we are tols we need to inputs: ``a`` and ``b``, both booleans. How to provide inputs for a *kiara* run command can
be a bit tricky if more complex input data types are required (e.g dicts). How to do this is explained [here](../..//usage/#complex-inputs).

For now, we don't need to worry about it because we only need booleans, which can be provided as ``true`` and ``false`` strings:

{{ cli("kiara", "run", "logic.xor", "a=true", "b=true") }}

In case we are interested in more than just the output field, we can re-run this command with the ``--explain`` flag:

{{ cli("kiara", "run", "--explain", "logic.xor", "a=true", "b=true", max_height=320) }}

### Saving outputs

It's very early days in the implementation of this feature, and it only works for the ``table`` and ``network_graph`` data
types, but basically, all you need to do is add the ``-save`` flag, and *kiara* will store the result data as items in the
*kiara* data store (in the format: ``[workflow_id].[output_name]``)

Let's say we want to create an (Apache arrow) table object out of a csv file, and store it in the data store, we could use
the ``tabular.import_table_from_file`` module:

{{ cli('kiara', 'run', '--output', 'format=silent', '--save', 'table_import_example', 'table.import.from_local_file', 'path=docs/example_data/JournalNodes1902.csv') }}

Now we can check that our table is present in our data store:

{{ cli('kiara', 'data', 'list') }}
